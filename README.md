# Project Scenario
Alex Carter is a journalist covering NCAA Division I Football, focusing on the upcoming SEC Championship Game. To prepare, she needs detailed data on the teams, players, referees, and in-game events from the current season. She reaches out to a coworker to help her gather key insights, including team performance trends, player statistics, penalty calls, and new recruits attending the game. By leveraging this data, Alex aims to write an in-depth analytical article that provides a unique perspective on the matchup, helping her stand out in the competitive world of sports journalism.
